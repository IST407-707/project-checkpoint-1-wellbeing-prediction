## Introduction
In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) included Burn-out in the 11 th  revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). Burn-out is defined in ICD-11 as, “a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.” They characterize burnout as feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job; and reduced professional efficacy.

 The WHO did not classify it as a medical condition but rather characterized it as an occupational phenomenon. Shortly after this addition, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, exacerbating the pre-existing mental health crisis and brought the experiences of burnout among frontline workers to the forefront. In the years since, discourse surrounding burnout has expanded from affecting frontline workers to affecting people across the board both in relation to the workplace and life in general. 

With 'Burn-out' being a relatively 'new' phenomenon recognized by Public Health institutions, there are not many metrics available to identify this phenomenon, track it, provide stopgaps and supporting resources to aid populations who may be in crisis. 

## Literature Review
The project builds upon a rich foundation of interdisciplinary research that has explored various facets of burnout, including its psychological underpinnings, physiological manifestations, and socio-economic correlations. Previous studies have identified key health indicators such as sleep disturbances, hormonal imbalances, and cardiovascular metrics as potential markers of burnout. Additionally, research in the realm of social sciences has shed light on how job insecurity, workplace culture, and economic stressors contribute to the prevalence of burnout. By synthesizing these diverse strands of literature, the project aims to carve out new pathways for understanding and addressing burnout.

## Data and Methods
Utilizing the WHO definition of Burnout as a guide, this project aims to evaluate Burnout through a geospatial lens by assessing correlation among the cumulative conditions that affect wellbeing.  Identifying local stressors that can be used as proxies to locate populations at highest risk can aid researchers and policymakers to understand the scope of this phenomenon.

## Data Collection
Data from the County Health Rankings for 2019 and 2023 are used to evaluate the spatial distribution and temporal change of the average number days of poor physical health and poor mental health reported as well as their correlation to: Unemployment rate, Food Insecurity, Excessive Drinking, Insufficient Sleep, Income Inequality Ratio, Frequent Mental Distress, Frequent Physical Distress, Disconnected Youth, Child Poverty rate, Suicide rate, Firearm Fatality rate, Median Household Income by race and Life Expectancy by race.

## Data Sources
The County Health Rankings datasets are a collaboration between the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, which compiles county-level measures from a variety of national and state data sources that aims to measure the health of nearly all counties in the nation and rank them. These data sources include the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey Data, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the American Community Survey. These measures are standardized and combined using scientifically informed weights.

## Analysis
Statistical Techniques: The project will utilize advanced statistical methods to unearth correlations and discern patterns among the collected health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and instances of burnout.
Machine Learning Algorithms: These algorithms will be deployed to construct predictive models capable of assessing an individual's risk of burnout based on their health and socioeconomic profiles.


## Project Plan
The research will unfold over a series of phases, beginning with the design and distribution of surveys and the collection of biometric data. This will be followed by an extensive data analysis phase, employing both statistical and machine learning techniques to identify key predictors of burnout and to develop predictive models. The final phase will focus on synthesizing the findings into actionable policy recommendations and preventive strategies aimed at reducing the incidence of burnout across different population groups.


## Risks
The project acknowledges several potential risks, including challenges in recruiting a representative sample, ensuring the accuracy of self-reported data, and the complexity of isolating variables in the multifaceted phenomenon of burnout. Additionally, ethical considerations related to privacy and data security will be paramount, requiring rigorous safeguards to protect participant information.
